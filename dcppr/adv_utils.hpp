// adv_utils.h
// may be merged with adv_argutils and derot, but needs to implement:
// - determine the gradient between x/t points
//   - this is relatively easy; the points are linearly spaced in time and 1-dim
//   - this is also central finite difference
// - a 3-polynomical fitting / evaluation routine
//   - polyval is easy
//   - polyfit is central finite difference + Gauss-Siedel
